Some notes on installing the source.

The file module/Pelement.pm has directory settings for various parts
of the filesystem needed. For a client connection the important
one is probably only $PELEMENT_LOG for log files.

The top level Makefile also has INSTALLDIR set top level
installation directory of the scripts. This also should be reset.
This Makefile also has a hostname check for installing the cgi scripts;
locally we have on a served from a machine not using an NFS mounted
location for the htdocs.
