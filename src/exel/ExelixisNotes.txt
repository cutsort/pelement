I) Data Sources

  There are 2 sources for the base data:


1) Exelixis CDROM of phred sequence

The bulk of Exelixis data is from a file off a CDR of phred calls and
associated phred quality values. The raw files were named by Exelixis
tnsSequences.txt and tnsQuality.txt. For reference, the fingerprint on
the files are

176e5112cd7b13138bffd884530245ad  tnsSequences.txt
53bddf33c0d1afce2eb180b33327c8cf  tnsQuality.txt

There are 52,183 entries in this file. These break into 4 collections,

Collection  Total Seq   Number of 3'   Number of 5'  Number of Strains
    PB       15,099        6,493          8,606           4,737
    XP       15,516        6,295          9,221           6,832
    RB        8,780        4,782          3,998           3,919
    WH       12,788        6,908          5,880           6,656
  Total      52,183       24,478         27,705          22,144 

The PB strains are labeled a designator of the form cNNNNN (N's are
digits 0-9), the XP are dNNNNN, the RB are named eNNNNN, and the WH are
fNNNNN.

There are not 2 end reads for each strain. For the PB collection, there
are 7,984 distinct combinations of strain name and end. There are 3,880
cases where there is just 1 read for a given PB strain and end (either
5' or 3') and 4,104 PB strains with multiple reads on one end or
another. For the other collections the number are:

Collection  Distinct Seq and End   # with 1 read    # with more than 1 read 
    PB               7,984            3,880             4,104
    XP              10,335            6,822             3,513
    RB               6,512            4,641             1,871
    WH              11,454           10,190             1,264
  Total             36,285           25,533            10,752

This is the data set that I'm calling the 'lane data'.

2) Supplemental Tables

I have the supplemental tables of cutouts from release 2 genome from
TXXX et al. These are loaded directly the pelement project's database
of flanking sequence with identifiers named strain_name.cutoutN. N is a
number that counts the number of cutout for that strain.

Collection  Distinct Strain IDs   # of Cutouts
    PB           3,685               4,427
    XP           3,761               4,031
    RB           3,364               3,559
    WH           5,718               5,935
  Total         16,528              17,952

The genomic cutouts were blasted and aligned to release 3 genome.
17,678 of these aligned automatically to release 3, 269 aligned in
multiple locations. Only 5 did not align. My impression is that most of
the cases of multiple alignments is that there is 1 alignment for a
flank in euchromatin and other alignments in heterchromatic scaffolds.

There are 5 strains with data only present in the supplemental tables:
c06765, e04237, f02744, f05785, and f07543. Other than those 5, the
lane data is a superset of the data from the supplemental tables.

Integration

The problem would be trivial if there were at most 1 read from each
strain and end. The ambiguities arise since there strains with lane
data from either the 5' or 3' end multiple times. I cannot say at
first which data is the reference. I've done this in a 3 part
process:

      a) for the cases where I have multiple lane data sequence for a
      given strain and end, I vector and quality trim all traces,
      then align with sim4 each one individually to the supplied
      genomic cutout. Read data that aligned to a genomic cutout was
      imported into the database and the corresponding genomic cutout
      was renamed from strain.cutoutN to strain.oldcutN. Read data
      which did not align was assumed to be a failure. In some cases
      I see different sets of end read data align to different
      genomic cutouts. In this case, I import this data as if it were
      multiple insertions.

      b) for the cases where we only have 1 sequence for a given
      strain and end, I processed the sequence data normally. I
      vector and quality trimed, then imported the sequence, blasted
      and aligned it to the release 3 genome. I went back to the
      sequence from the cutouts and saw which genomic cutout data
      could be subsumed by the data. The genomic cutout was renamed
      to strain.oldcutN

      To illustrate, assume I have 1 end read from the 3' end of
      c12345, and 2 end reads from the 5' end, and there were genomic
      cutouts associated with c12345. One outcome would be that I
      processed the 2 lanes of the 5' end and saw one of the cutout
      match 1 lane of the 5' end. I imported that 5' end read as the
      reference read for this end and renamed the cutout. I processed
      the 3' end normally and renamed any genomic cutout if it was
      similar to the flanking sequence.

      The final step is:

      c) there was some data left over from the cases of duplicated
      flank data where none of it aligned. I processed all end reads
      from the flanks.  and imported these into the database as
      'unconfirmed recheck' sequences.  I looked at these cases
      manually. In many cases, I could make the decision of what is
      the reference data by seeing which lane data aligned to the
      same location as the cutout.


Imported Sequence

Some numbers for the strains with data:

  Collection        Strains with         Strains with       Strains with
                 Lane & Cutout data    Only Cutout data     Only Lane data

     PB                3,559                 126               606
     XP                3,599                 162              2199
     RB                3,281                  83               459
     WH                5,554                 164               822
   Total              15,993                 535              4086

I'm comfortable with submitting processed lane data for all cases in
the first and third categories. I'm not in favor of submitting the
cutout data for the second class:  in many cases, these are instances
where the lane data is showing some similarity to the cutout data, but
it has multiple alignments in heterchromatin. These may have been too
agressively aligned when the cutouts were done.

The third category of strains may be irrelevant; if they weren't
described in the paper, then they're not part of any collection, or are
they?

In category 2, some of these are cases where I have lane data - all from
multiple sequencing records - but none of it matches the cutout, while
other cases are instances where I was not able to process the lane data
and get anything out above our thresholds. The number of strains where
I have no processed lane data are 70 for PB, 113 for XP, 60 for RB and 
150 for WH. (these number include the 5 strains for which there is
no lane data.)

Category 1 includes unsubsumed genomic cutouts. That is, if
I have unique sequence for a flank, I import that data even if it does
not match the genomic cutout. There are cases of strains with only
1 sequencing attempt, but multiple genomic cutouts. These are not
multiple insertion lines, but rather seem to be ambiguous alignments
to the release 2 genome. There are 438 PB strains with unsubsumed
cutouts, 451 XP strains, 136 RB strains and 181 WH strains. These are
all examples of cases where we will be unable to confirm the Exelixis
published data.


Alignment

I've done the blasting and automated alignment. I'll be sending the
positions I get for all uniquely alignable strains. The number of
the uniquely alignable strains based on lane data is:

   Collection      Strains with unique alignment
      PB                  3,289
      XP                  4,286
      RB                  3,193
      WH                  5,384

These numbers include strains from categories 1 and 3 from above. I have not
broken them down into the two classes. Note that these will include cases
of 3' and 5' flanks each uniquely aligning to different locations.

Here is the full list of 535 strains with no lane data. Can someone
check on the permanent collection lists they have (I'll check against
mine as well) to see if any of these should be looked at:
