Normal Processing

1) Registration of Benchwork.

The normal procedure for experimental data is:
	a) registration of a plate of strains
	b) digestion
	c) ligation
	d) iPCR
	e) sequencing
	f) gels

Registering of each of these steps happens through a web interface by
Martha at the bench. There are typically 95 samples in a plate with
strain identifiers generated by Baylor. Each of these steps populates a
corresponding table in the database which records who and when the step
was done and the important associated details.

When the gels are done, Martha will send an email notifying the person
processing them.

2) Processing of the data.

The normal workflow of data depends on whether the data consists of new
or recheck sequences.

For either data type, the first step is to move the chromats from their
INBOX location to the archive directory space. This is done with a script
moveTraces.pl

For new data, the processing steps are:

	a) base calling
	b) sequence trimming
	c) sequence importing

For recheck data, the steps are:

	a) base calling
	b) sequence trimming
	c) consensus building
	d) recheck sequence importing

There are corresponding scripts baseCaller.pl, seqTrimmer.pl seqImporter.pl
and buildConsensus.pl. All of these take an argument '-gel <gel_name>'
Because of the routine nature of these processing steps, there is a
script to invoke these tasks gelMaster.pl. This takes as an argument a
list of gels to process (without a -gel option).

After processing the data, there is a step of blasting and aligning.
These are typically handled by the scripts runBlast.pl and alignSeq.pl
Again, from the routine nature of these, there is a master script
blastMaster.pl. It does not take an argument.


In summary, the normal processing flow is:

1) run moveTraces.pl

Check for gels that got transferred. They usually come in pairs.

2) run gelMaster.pl PT_gel1 PT_gel2

Check for abnormal behavior or many error messages

3) run blastMaster.pl
